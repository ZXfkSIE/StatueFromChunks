# Statue From Chunks
A RimWorld 1.2+ MOD to make statues (sculptures) from stone chunks

### DECLARATION
This is an update of the [original 1.1 mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2008903395) by Joseph under his declaration:
> I am no longer maintaining this mod. anyone who wishes may use it or any part of it to continue the mod.

While porting it to RimWorld 1.2, I have made following changes:
1. The original XML codes adjusted vanilla game defs by overwriting them directly, which is not recommended and actually caused incompatibility problem with RW 1.2 . I rewrite them to XML Patch Operations.
1. Remove the new textures of statues. Now there is no difference between the appearance of "sculpture" and "statue".
1. Increase the material amount of one grand statue.
1. Increase the working time for making a statue.
1. Add Chinese and Japanese language files.

### INTRODUCTION
Ever wonder why stone chunks needed to be cut into blocks before being sculpted into statues? I did, and then I decided that was silly, and made a mod to stop it.

This mod adds an option to craft statues out of stone chunks. A sculpture crafted from chunk(s) is called statue, which plays the same role as a vanilla sculpture.

Every small, large and grand statue costs 1, 2 and 8 chunk(s), respectively. If you calculate the material cost between a statue and a sculpture, you will find that making statue saves the amount of material a lot, at the cost of 10% more work amount.

A separate recipe has to be used to craft with chunks.

### SUPPORTED LANGUAGE
English, Simp./Trad. Chinese, Japanese.

Since the "statue" is actually all the same as "sculpture", it is very easy to make localization for this MOD. Most of the text can be directly copied from vanilla language files, and there are only 2 words you need to translate: "**chunky**" (a stuff category) and "**statue**" (just another word of "sculpture"). Feel free to make your own language files or just tell me the translation of these 2 words in your language!

### COMPATIBILITY
It should be compatible with all mods that add new textures to vanilla sculptures, e.g. More Sculpture.
It is completely safe to be added to an existing save data.
